    The code should be quite self explainatory, but hereâ€™s what it does in short:
    
    Connect to the SSH server
    Send the command (non-blocking)
    Create a loop, waiting for the channel to get an exist code
    The loop is looking for data to pring (stdout.channel.recv_ready()) and prints any data it receives
